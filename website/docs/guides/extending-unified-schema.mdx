We saw on the ["How to: Combine multiple Sources"](/docs/howtos/combine-multiple-sources) guide that `additionalResolvers` can be used to shape and augment the Unified Schema with custom resolvers.

However, the `additionalResolvers` value can also be the path to a JavaScript/TypeScript file that exports the custom resolvers implementation.

In our ["How to: Combine multiple Sources"](/docs/howtos/combine-multiple-sources) Gateway, the `Book.author` custom resolver could have been provided programatically as shown below:

**.meshrc.yaml**

```yaml
sources:
  # ...
transforms:
  # ...
additionalTypeDefs: |
  extend type Book {
    author: authors_v1_Author
  }
additionalResolvers: "./additionalResolvers.ts"
```

**additionalResolvers.ts**
```ts
import { Resolvers } from './mesh'

const resolvers: Resolvers = {
  Book: {
    author: async (root, args, context, info) => {
      return await context.Authors.Query.authors_v1_AuthorsService_GetAuthor({
        root,
        args: {
          id: args.authorId
        },
        context,
        info
      })
    }
  }
}

export default resolvers
```

Mesh relies on [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) to generate the `Resolvers` type that give you access to:
- fully typed resolvers map
- fully typed SDK (through the `context`) to fetch data from Sources
